<p>I'm feeling pretty good about my ability to keep up with the pace. The deep review of javascript fundamentals combined with a positive attitude will hopefully carry me through! </p>

<p>I'm very impressed with Marcus Phillips and his approach to education. To me, he had always seemed to be a bit of a mini-celebrity, but he really takes the time to get to know the ~80 students per cohort by name. He's very down to earth, and <strong>very</strong> straightforward. He doesn't sugar-coat anything; rather he helps identify problems and barriers directly. He gave a few talks on success and how to learn coding; it was incredibly interesting to understand both the intellectual and emotional barriers to coding. </p>

<p>In a moment of self assessment, I recognized that the self-induced stress that I impose on myself during performance situations was going to be a sticking point. Marcus's advice - exposure therapy. Having been to many CBT sessions, I almost wonder if he has a psychology background.</p>

<p>Pairing is a new type of challenge. Sometimes it speeds you up, and sometimes it slows you down. In all cases, it forces you to justify everything that you do. If you can't justify it, your partner won't follow. If you can't put it into words, it's not going to happen. It's forced me to understand javascript more deeply than I ever have. </p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
