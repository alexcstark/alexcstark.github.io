            <p>I think it's important to note that I did not pass the technical interview the first time...or the second time. </p>

<p>Getting into HR required a lot of studying. I <strong>did not</strong> remotely think that I would be this far along before even starting a bootcamp. It really seems like  you need to be able to make use of all the free resources out there, and then HR will fill in the gaps. </p>

<p>I first applied in January 2016. I bombed the technical interview. I got so nervous and choked up. My mind went blank. It was not my best work. </p>

<p>So I went to studying. I studied higher order functions, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Node, Express...I went way overboard on non-essentials. </p>

<p>I decided I needed more guidance and entered Fulcrum. Fulcrum is amazing. I highly recommend it. Fulcrum helps you get up to speed on exactly what you need to know in regards to Javascript fundamentals. If you're serious about attending Hack Reactor, I can't recommend Fulcrum highly enough. </p>

<p>I prepared like crazy for the technical interview and memorized many many underscore functions. Bad idea. They care about problem solving, not memorization. I did not pass the second interview: I choked, I panicked, I blanked. </p>

<p>There's an underrated and under-appreciated skill that I had yet to develop: can you do technical work while someone else who has the answers judges you? Can you be a humble and vulnerable learner? Can you adapt to a teacher's corrections? </p>

<p><strong>Practice this</strong> </p>

<p>What made me succeed in my third interview is repeated practice of technical interviews. I reached out to all of my dev friends and did skype as well as whiteboard interviews (that were above my skill level). </p>

<p>Thank you Conrad Wimberly and Landon Schropp, two of my practice interviewers!</p>

<p>Over time, I gradually became more comfortable with that type of coding. It's different, treat it as a separate skill. </p>

<p>Hope this helps! </p>
